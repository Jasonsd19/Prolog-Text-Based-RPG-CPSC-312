1) You enter the room and see a woman in a dress being held captive by a guard. By the door opposite the woman you 
   see a great battle axe against the wall. The guard hasn't seen you yet, so you can either try to take out
   the guard and save the woman or grab the axe and run through the door. Save the woman or grab the axe? (S/A)
	S = If player_weapon = club, (Go to 2), otherwise (Go to 3)
	A = (Go to 4)

2) You club the guard on the head, scoring a critical hit, and he falls to the ground. You turn toward toward the
   woman and begin untying the ropes that hold her. When you remove the cloth from over her mouth she screeches,
   for the guard has crawled over to the wall and grabbed the battle axe, and now swings it clean through your
   neck before you can react. (Game Over)

3) You sneak up behind the guard and stab him through the heart, killing him instantly. You untie the woman, but
   she grabs the axe and runs back the way that you came from. (Go to 5)

4) You sneak around the guard and grab the battle axe (7 atk), then turn toward the door, leaving the woman behind. (Next)

5) You go through the door which leads to the final room, where the monster guards the dungeon's exit. (Go to node 10)
