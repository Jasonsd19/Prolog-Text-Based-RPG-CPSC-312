1) You enter the room and see a woman in a dress being held captive by a guard. By the door opposite the woman you 
   see a suit of plate armor against the wall. The guard hasn't seen you yet, so you can either try to take out
   the guard and save the woman or grab the armor and run through the door. Save the woman or grab the armor? (S/A)
	S = If player_weapon = club, (Go to 2), otherwise (Go to 3)
	A = (Go to 4)

2) You club the guard on the head, scoring a critical hit, and he falls to the ground. You turn toward toward the
   woman and begin untying the ropes that hold her. When you remove the cloth from over her mouth she screeches,
   for the guard has crawled behind you, stood up, and drawn his dagger, and now cuts your throat with it before you can react.
   (Game Over)

3) You sneak up behind the guard and stab him through the heart, killing him instantly. You untie the woman, but
   she grabs the plate armor and runs back the way that you came from. (Go to 5)

4) You sneak around the guard and grab the plate armor (6 def), then turn toward the door, leaving the woman behind. 
   (Next)

5) You go through the door which leads to the final room, where the monster guards the dungeon's exit.
